    <h2 align="center">A Mixed Reality Application for Foreign Language Learning in Children with Language Disorders</h2>
    <br>
    <p align="center">Do You Speak Holo?! is an application for Microsoft HoloLens co-designed with linguistics experts that aims to facilitate the learning process of a foreign language for children and adolescents with language disorders (LD). The application includes several educational activities, aimed at improving both vocabulary and morphosyntactic aspects of the language through the interaction with virtual content immersed in the real world. Each activity is divided into two steps: a learning phase, where the user acquires knowledge about the linguistic concepts, and a practice phase, in which he tests the knowledge acquired by interacting with the digital content produced by HoloLens. A key element of the application is the presence of a virtual assistant, which acts as a virtual teacher and guides the user step by step in the comprehension and execution of the educational activities.</p>
